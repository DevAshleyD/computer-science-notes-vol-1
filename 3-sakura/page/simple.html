      <p class="body-text">Cherry blossoms, or sakura, mark the coming of spring in Japan. The slightest wind picks the petals off its branches and makes them flutter into the air, creating a flurry of pink and white that the Japanese call <em>sakura fubuki</em>, or sakura blizzard.

      Its fragility evokes a sense of <em>mono no aware</em> (もののあはれ) - an awareness of the impernance and transience of things - as captured by the tenth-century poet Ki no Tomonori (紀友則):

      <blockquote>
      <em>Hisakata no/ hikari nodokeki/ haru no hi ni<br>
      Shizu kokoro naku/ nana no chiruramu</em></blockquote>

      <blockquote>In these spring days<br>
      with the tranquil light encompassing<br>
      The four directions<br>
      why should the blossoms scatter<br>
      with uneasy hearts?

      <p class="body-text">Cherry blossoms bloom early in Okinawa, the cluster of islands in the southern-most part of Japan. In Naha, the capital of Okinawa prefecture, cherry blossoms typically bloom from mid January to early February. Sometimes, they even begin blooming in late December.

    <p class='body-text'>Cherry blossoms in Okinawa are famous for their bold, magenta petals, which slightly droop toward the earth. Go for a stroll around Nakijin castle, a world heritage site, at night - and revel in the beauty of the pink petals lighting up against the 14th-century ruins.</p>

      If you want to see cherry blossoms and snow all in one trip, travel up the country and head to Hokkaido.<br><br>

      While cherry blossoms are blooming in Okinawa, Hokkaido is deeply covered in snow. You can go ski on the powder snow in Niseko or have your breath taken away by the ice sculptures at the Sapporo Snow Festival, one of the most famous winter festivals in the world.</p>

      <p class="body-text">March is the peak cherry blossom season in Japan - you can go to Tokyo, Kyoto, or Osaka and most likely catch them in bloom. But if you are visiting Japan in April or May, go up north to Fukushima, Aomori or Hokkaido to revel in the flurry of fluttering sakura petals.

      From mid-to-late May, seven hundred sakura trees bloom in Beppo Park, giving you one last chance to enjoy spring.<br><br>

      While cherry blossoms are blooming in Kushiro, Okinawa is sliding into summer. It's 22 to 27 degrees Celcius in Naha, and if you time it right, you can drink sake under the sakura in Kushiro then hop over to Naha for its annual <em>Naha haarii</em> festival, or Naha dragonboat race. This race, which originated in China and was transmitted to Okinawa about 600 years ago, is the largest dragonboat race in Okinawa.</p>
