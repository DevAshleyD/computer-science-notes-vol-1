(EPA/Diego Azubel))    Oscar Pistorius, the South African \"Blade Runner,\" won his second gold medal of the Beijing Paralympics with a victory in the 200-meter sprint on Saturday, but the day was marked by controversy as the Iran wheelchair basketball team pulled out of the Games ahead of a possible matchup against Israel.  The Iran team was scheduled to play the United States on Saturday in a quarterfinal-round match but withdrew before the game. The winner would go on to meet the winner of the Canada-Israel game.   A spokesman for the Iranian delegation denied that Iran pulled out because of the possibility of playing Israel. The country has had a longstanding no-contact policy with Israel, and Iranian athletes have pulled out of events rather than meet Israelis in sports events.   The spokesman said that the Iran wheelchair basketball team withdrew because the Beijing organizers had swapped the starting times of the US-Iran and Canada-Israel matches. That swap had been made without explanation.  \"Each match should be done one after another,\" Iran deputy chef de mission Iran Doust said. \"But unfortunately, concerning our match they didn\\'t observe the order and that\\'s the reason\" for the pullout.  As it happened, Canada defeated Israel. The Canadians will face the Americans on Sunday.  TRACK AND FIELD: Pistorius won his second gold at the Bird\\'s Nest before a crowd of more than 50,000, taking the 200 meters by nearly a full second over the silver medalist, Jim Bob Bizzell of the U.S.  \"This race is definitely going down as one of my best ever races,\" Pistorius said. \"I\\'ve never run in front of a crowd this big and just the crowd, the athletes, it was an awesome race and I couldn\\'t have hoped for anything better.\"  He has one race to go, the 400 meters on Sunday.     China won five gold medals at the stadium on Saturday. Eighteen-year-old Yang Sen won the men\\'s 100-meter T35 in a world record 12.29 seconds, while Wang Fang retained her crown in women\\'s 200-meter T36. Yu Shiranwon the men\\'s 200-meter T53, and Xia Dong (men\\'s shot put) and Jimisu Menggen (women\\'s discus throw) won gold medals with world-record performances.  Xinhua\\'s wrapup of the day\\'s action is at this link.  The International Paralympic Committee\\'s \"Sixty Seconds\" YouTube show for Friday/Saturday (see window below) begins its highlights package with Friday\\'s Canadian sweep of the women\\'s 200-meter medley (SM13). Chelsey Gotell of Antigonish, N.S., finished first in a world record 2 minutes 28.15 seconds, followed by Winnipeg\\'s Kirby Cote of Winnipeg and Valerie Grand\\'Maison of Montreal. That\\'s followed by early Saturday road racing action, including American Oz Sanchez\\'s gold medal in the 12.7-kilometer hand-pedaled cycle time trial with an average of 23.35 mph, and the victory by Heinz Frei of Switzerland in another HC category. There\\'s also football seven-a-side (S9) action, with Russia taking on Brazil:    Universalsports.com\\'s re-stream of its coverage of Saturday\\'s track and field events is available at this link. The site\\'s one-hour-20-minute highlight package from Saturday\\'s early events are at this link.  SWIMMING: At the Water Cube, Erin Popovich finally didn\\'t win a gold medal -- she won a silver. Popovich finished second to Huang Min of China in the women\\'s 50-meter butterfly (S7). \"She took it out fast and had a better race than me,\" Popovich said. \"Hats off to her. China is having a phenomenal meet.\"  Popovich, who has won 4 golds at these Games and 14 in her Paralympic career, has one more race in Beijing: the 50-meter freestyle on Sunday.   Justin Zook of the U.S. won gold in the men\\'s 100-meter backstroke (S10) after setting a world record in the preliminary heat of the event.   Countryman Jarrett Perry also set a world record during a preliminary heat of his event, the 100-meter backstroke (S9), but the final was won by Australian Matthew Cowdrey, his third of the Beijing Games to go along with two more from Athens 2004. Perry took the bronze.  WHEELCHAIR RUGBY: The American team had its hands full with a tough Japan team, winning by 44-37.

Two big stars -- one already famous, the other emerging -- dominated the headlines in the pool and on the track in Beijing on Sunday.   South African swimmer Natalie Du Toit won her fifth gold medal of these Paralympics, winning the 50-meter freestyle at the Water Cube, while Canadian wheelchair racer Chantal Petitclerc won the 800 meters at the Bird\\'s Nest to go along with her golds from 100, 200 and 400 meters.  Other stars made headlines in the swimming competition. Australia\\'s Matthew Cowdrey won the men\\'s 50-meter freestyle for his fourth gold medal of the Games.   Erin Popovich of the U.S. just missed capturing her fifth Beijing gold, finishing eight one-hundredths of a second behind 17-year-old countrywoman Cortney Jordan in the 50-meter freestyle final of her class. It was Popovich\\'s second silver and Jordan\\'s first goal of these Games.  Here\\'s the BBC on Du Toit and Australia\\'s ABC on Cowdrey.  At the track, Petitclerc pulled off the amazing feat of winning the finals of the 200- and 800-meter races within 90 minutes. \"I\\'ve never done that in my life,\" she said afterward. \"I told my coach, never again. This was a stressful day.\"  Here\\'s the Canadian Press\\'s story on Petitclerc.  In wheelchair tennis, Dutch star Esther Vergeer took gold by winning her 349th consecutive match -- but it was very close. She edged teammate Korie Howman in a dramatic tiebreaker, 6-2, 4-6, 7-6 (5), and extended her unbeate streak to five and a half years. Here\\'s the AP on Vergeer\\'s victory.  There was also controversy on Sunday, as Britain\\'s Rebecca Chin\\'s silver medal in the cerebral palsy class of the discus was revoked because she was judged not to have been impaired to the appropriate extent.  \"The athlete showed significantly different skill sets and subsequently the chief classifier lodged a protest under exceptional circumstances,\" an International Paralympic Committee spokeswoman said. \"The athlete is found not eligible, not matching the sport class profile.\"  The Press Association\\'s article on the Chin controversy is here.   A similar decision resulted in the expulsion of Irish seven-a-side footballer Derek Malone last week (Irish Times article here), prompting the BBC to ask, \"How disabled must a Paralympian be?\" ',\n",

(EPA/Diego Azubel))    Oscar Pistorius, the South African \"Blade Runner,\" won his second gold medal of the Beijing Paralympics with a victory in the 200-meter sprint on Saturday, but the day was marked by controversy as the Iran wheelchair basketball team pulled out of the Games ahead of a possible matchup against Israel.  The Iran team was scheduled to play the United States on Saturday in a quarterfinal-round match but withdrew before the game. The winner would go on to meet the winner of the Canada-Israel game.   A spokesman for the Iranian delegation denied that Iran pulled out because of the possibility of playing Israel. The country has had a longstanding no-contact policy with Israel, and Iranian athletes have pulled out of events rather than meet Israelis in sports events.   The spokesman said that the Iran wheelchair basketball team withdrew because the Beijing organizers had swapped the starting times of the US-Iran and Canada-Israel matches. That swap had been made without explanation.  \"Each match should be done one after another,\" Iran deputy chef de mission Iran Doust said. \"But unfortunately, concerning our match they didn\\'t observe the order and that\\'s the reason\" for the pullout.  As it happened, Canada defeated Israel. The Canadians will face the Americans on Sunday.  TRACK AND FIELD: Pistorius won his second gold at the Bird\\'s Nest before a crowd of more than 50,000, taking the 200 meters by nearly a full second over the silver medalist, Jim Bob Bizzell of the U.S.  \"This race is definitely going down as one of my best ever races,\" Pistorius said. \"I\\'ve never run in front of a crowd this big and just the crowd, the athletes, it was an awesome race and I couldn\\'t have hoped for anything better.\"  He has one race to go, the 400 meters on Sunday.     China won five gold medals at the stadium on Saturday. Eighteen-year-old Yang Sen won the men\\'s 100-meter T35 in a world record 12.29 seconds, while Wang Fang retained her crown in women\\'s 200-meter T36. Yu Shiranwon the men\\'s 200-meter T53, and Xia Dong (men\\'s shot put) and Jimisu Menggen (women\\'s discus throw) won gold medals with world-record performances.  Xinhua\\'s wrapup of the day\\'s action is at this link.  The International Paralympic Committee\\'s \"Sixty Seconds\" YouTube show for Friday/Saturday (see window below) begins its highlights package with Friday\\'s Canadian sweep of the women\\'s 200-meter medley (SM13). Chelsey Gotell of Antigonish, N.S., finished first in a world record 2 minutes 28.15 seconds, followed by Winnipeg\\'s Kirby Cote of Winnipeg and Valerie Grand\\'Maison of Montreal. That\\'s followed by early Saturday road racing action, including American Oz Sanchez\\'s gold medal in the 12.7-kilometer hand-pedaled cycle time trial with an average of 23.35 mph, and the victory by Heinz Frei of Switzerland in another HC category. There\\'s also football seven-a-side (S9) action, with Russia taking on Brazil:    Universalsports.com\\'s re-stream of its coverage of Saturday\\'s track and field events is available at this link. The site\\'s one-hour-20-minute highlight package from Saturday\\'s early events are at this link.  SWIMMING: At the Water Cube, Erin Popovich finally didn\\'t win a gold medal -- she won a silver. Popovich finished second to Huang Min of China in the women\\'s 50-meter butterfly (S7). \"She took it out fast and had a better race than me,\" Popovich said. \"Hats off to her. China is having a phenomenal meet.\"  Popovich, who has won 4 golds at these Games and 14 in her Paralympic career, has one more race in Beijing: the 50-meter freestyle on Sunday.   Justin Zook of the U.S. won gold in the men\\'s 100-meter backstroke (S10) after setting a world record in the preliminary heat of the event.   Countryman Jarrett Perry also set a world record during a preliminary heat of his event, the 100-meter backstroke (S9), but the final was won by Australian Matthew Cowdrey, his third of the Beijing Games to go along with two more from Athens 2004. Perry took the bronze.  WHEELCHAIR RUGBY: The American team had its hands full with a tough Japan team, winning by 44-37.

Two big stars -- one already famous, the other emerging -- dominated the headlines in the pool and on the track in Beijing on Sunday.   South African swimmer Natalie Du Toit won her fifth gold medal of these Paralympics, winning the 50-meter freestyle at the Water Cube, while Canadian wheelchair racer Chantal Petitclerc won the 800 meters at the Bird\\'s Nest to go along with her golds from 100, 200 and 400 meters.  Other stars made headlines in the swimming competition. Australia\\'s Matthew Cowdrey won the men\\'s 50-meter freestyle for his fourth gold medal of the Games.   Erin Popovich of the U.S. just missed capturing her fifth Beijing gold, finishing eight one-hundredths of a second behind 17-year-old countrywoman Cortney Jordan in the 50-meter freestyle final of her class. It was Popovich\\'s second silver and Jordan\\'s first goal of these Games.  Here\\'s the BBC on Du Toit and Australia\\'s ABC on Cowdrey.  At the track, Petitclerc pulled off the amazing feat of winning the finals of the 200- and 800-meter races within 90 minutes. \"I\\'ve never done that in my life,\" she said afterward. \"I told my coach, never again. This was a stressful day.\"  Here\\'s the Canadian Press\\'s story on Petitclerc.  In wheelchair tennis, Dutch star Esther Vergeer took gold by winning her 349th consecutive match -- but it was very close. She edged teammate Korie Howman in a dramatic tiebreaker, 6-2, 4-6, 7-6 (5), and extended her unbeate streak to five and a half years. Here\\'s the AP on Vergeer\\'s victory.  There was also controversy on Sunday, as Britain\\'s Rebecca Chin\\'s silver medal in the cerebral palsy class of the discus was revoked because she was judged not to have been impaired to the appropriate extent.  \"The athlete showed significantly different skill sets and subsequently the chief classifier lodged a protest under exceptional circumstances,\" an International Paralympic Committee spokeswoman said. \"The athlete is found not eligible, not matching the sport class profile.\"  The Press Association\\'s article on the Chin controversy is here.

And so it did for Rudy Garcia-Tolson in the 200-meter individual medley swim on Sunday in Beijing. Garcia-Tolson, a native of Bloomington, Calif., set a new all-time mark at 2:38.70 to win his preliminary heat, and then topped that at 2:35.92 to win the gold medal.  \"I always like to save a little bit for the finals,\" said Garcia-Tolson, 19, a double above-the-knee amputee competing in the SM7 class. \"It was my best effort.\"  Garcia-Tolson was a second and a half behind Rong Tian of China after the first 50 meters swimming butterfly, but the last three legs are considered his strongest. He pulled ahead of Tian by the end of the second leg and ultimately beat him by more than 10 seconds. Tian won the silver and Matt Walker of Great Britain the bronze.  Garcia-Tolson has three more races left -- the 100-meter breastroke, 100-meter backstroke and 400-meter freestyle --\\xad and plans to train for ironman competition following these Paralympics. His athletic journey might only be beginning, 14 years after 15 operations on his legs failed to fix a birth defect to the point where, at age 5, he asked doctors to amputate his legs.  \"I wanted to be as active as possible,\" Garcia-Tolson said in a telephone interview from Beijing. \"I wanted to be just like my friends and siblings. The way I was living in wheelchair wasn\\'t cutting it for me. I wanted to play football and hop walls. It was either stay in a wheelchair or get robot legs. It was a really easy decision.\"  (Photo: Erin Popovich after winning her gold medal. (Jamie McDonald/Getty Images))  Garcia-Tolson was one of nine U.S. swimmers to win medals on Sunday. Erin Popovich broke her own world record by nearly six seconds in the women\\'s 200-meter individual medley, winning her second straight Paralympic gold in the SM7 class with a time of 2:54:61.    Miranda Uhl, left, in her first Paralympics, won the SM6 class in the individual medley with another world-record time of 3:13.05.

The Sunday afternoon highlights are at this address.  For a recap of how the U.S. did on day one, go to the entry for Sept. 8 at http://www.usocpressbox.org.  CYCLING: Britain won three gold medals, giving the country four on the day, which tied the American\\'s first-day gold-medal haul.   Simon Richardson won the one-kilometer time trial for cyclists with lower-leg disabilities. Aileen McGlynn defended her one-kilometer time-trial title for blind cyclists. Darren Kenny took a third cycling gold with a victory in the individual pursuit. All three gold medalists set world records.   (Photo: Russia\\'s Victoria Potapova after winning a judo bronze in the women\\'s 48kg. class. (AP/Ng Han Guan))  JUDO: Chinese and Algerian athletes each won two gold medals. Guo Huaping and Cui Na won gold in the 48-kilogram and 52-kilogram women\\'s divisions, respectively.   \"I\\'ve been training for seven years -- it\\'s very hard,\" Cui said afterward. \"This is the first gold medal for our country in the 52-kilogram division. I also want to say, although we are disabled, we have very strong minds.\"   On the men\\'s side, Algeria\\'s Mouloud Noura captured the gold in the men\\'s 60-kilogram class, while Sidali Lamri beat three-time Paralympic champion Satoshi Fujimoto of Japan to win the gold in the men\\'s 66-kilogram division.  SHOOTING: The first gold medal of the Games went to Veronika Vadovicova of Slovakia, who won the women\\'s standing 10-meter air rifle event.  (Photo: U.S. vs. Israel on Sunday. (China Photos/Getty Images))  WHEELCHAIR BASKETBALL: The U.S. men\\'s team kicked off the Paralympic tournament with a dominating 76-53 victory over Israel.   The Americans struggled to escape the first quarter with a 1-point lead, which it grabbed on Steve Serio\\'s reverse lay-in at the buzzer. Serio and teammate Joe Chambers came off the bench to score the team\\'s first 11 points of the second quarter and helped push the U.S. to a 40-16 halftime lead.  \"Both teams had nerves coming out to start,\" Serio said. \"For me, it was easier to come off the bench because I had a chance to see the atmosphere and get a feel for exactly what I had to do to get going out there, and being on the court with Joe makes playing the game pretty easy.\"  GOALBALL: China beat Brazil, 5-3, with Lin Shan scoring a hat trick.  The American women beat Japan, 2-0, with two goals in the last minute of play.   The sport, for blind athletes, was invented in 1946. Three players on each side try to throw a ball equipped with bells into their opponents\\' goal. Partially sighted players wear blindfolds.

(AP/Greg Baker))   Natalie Du Toit, the South African who won five gold medals at the 2004 Paralympics and who finished 16th in the 20-kilometer open-water swim three weeks ago at the Beijing Olympics, added another Paralympic gold to her collection on Sunday when she won the 100-meter butterfly in her disability class.  Du Toit, who lost her left leg above the knee in a motorcycle crash in 2001, set a world record by finishing in 1 minute 6.74 seconds.  Also on Sunday, American swimmers won four gold medals.   Erin Popovich shattered her own world record in her disability class by nearly six seconds in the women\\'s 200-meter individual medley, defending her Paralympic title with a time of 2:54.61. Rudy Garcia-Tolson also held on to his 200-meter title with a world record time of 2:35.92. Miranda Uhl made her Paralympic debut in the 200-meter individual medley with a world-record time for her class of 3:13.05. And Jessica Long won gold in the women\\'s 100-meter butterfly with a time of 1:11.96.   Universalsports.com has complete swimming highlights of Day 1 competition at this Web address.   Universalsports.com\\'s highlight package of Saturday\\'s opening ceremony and Sunday morning\\'s competition in all sports is streamed at this address.  The Sunday afternoon highlights are at this address.  For a recap of how the U.S. did on day one, go to the entry for Sept. 8 at http://www.usocpressbox.org.  CYCLING: Britain won three gold medals, giving the country four on the day, which tied the American\\'s first-day gold-medal haul.   Simon Richardson won the one-kilometer time trial for cyclists with lower-leg disabilities. Aileen McGlynn defended her one-kilometer time-trial title for blind cyclists. Darren Kenny took a third cycling gold with a victory in the individual pursuit. All three gold medalists set world records.   (Photo: Russia\\'s Victoria Potapova after winning a judo bronze in the women\\'s 48kg. class. (AP/Ng Han Guan))  JUDO: Chinese and Algerian athletes each won two gold medals. Guo Huaping and Cui Na won gold in the 48-kilogram and 52-kilogram women\\'s divisions, respectively.   \"I\\'ve been training for seven years -- it\\'s very hard,\" Cui said afterward. \"This is the first gold medal for our country in the 52-kilogram division. I also want to say, although we are disabled, we have very strong minds.\"   On the men\\'s side, Algeria\\'s Mouloud Noura captured the gold in the men\\'s 60-kilogram class, while Sidali Lamri beat three-time Paralympic champion Satoshi Fujimoto of Japan to win the gold in the men\\'s 66-kilogram division.  SHOOTING: The first gold medal of the Games went to Veronika Vadovicova of Slovakia, who won the women\\'s standing 10-meter air rifle event.  (Photo: U.S. vs. Israel on Sunday. (China Photos/Getty Images))  WHEELCHAIR BASKETBALL: The U.S. men\\'s team kicked off the Paralympic tournament with a dominating 76-53 victory over Israel.   The Americans struggled to escape the first quarter with a 1-point lead, which it grabbed on Steve Serio\\'s reverse lay-in at the buzzer. Serio and teammate Joe Chambers came off the bench to score the team\\'s first 11 points of the second quarter and helped push the U.S. to a 40-16 halftime lead.  \"Both teams had nerves coming out to start,\" Serio said. \"For me, it was easier to come off the bench because I had a chance to see the atmosphere and get a feel for exactly what I had to do to get going out there, and being on the court with Joe makes playing the game pretty easy.\"  GOALBALL: China beat Brazil, 5-3, with Lin Shan scoring a hat trick.  The American women beat Japan, 2-0, with two goals in the last minute of play.   The sport, for blind athletes, was invented in 1946. Three players on each side try to throw a ball equipped with bells into their opponents\\' goal. Partially sighted players wear blindfolds.

(EPA/Diego Azubel))    Oscar Pistorius, the South African \"Blade Runner,\" won his second gold medal of the Beijing Paralympics with a victory in the 200-meter sprint on Saturday, but the day was marked by controversy as the Iran wheelchair basketball team pulled out of the Games ahead of a possible matchup against Israel.  The Iran team was scheduled to play the United States on Saturday in a quarterfinal-round match but withdrew before the game. The winner would go on to meet the winner of the Canada-Israel game.   A spokesman for the Iranian delegation denied that Iran pulled out because of the possibility of playing Israel. The country has had a longstanding no-contact policy with Israel, and Iranian athletes have pulled out of events rather than meet Israelis in sports events.   The spokesman said that the Iran wheelchair basketball team withdrew because the Beijing organizers had swapped the starting times of the US-Iran and Canada-Israel matches. That swap had been made without explanation.  \"Each match should be done one after another,\" Iran deputy chef de mission Iran Doust said. \"But unfortunately, concerning our match they didn\\'t observe the order and that\\'s the reason\" for the pullout.  As it happened, Canada defeated Israel. The Canadians will face the Americans on Sunday.  TRACK AND FIELD: Pistorius won his second gold at the Bird\\'s Nest before a crowd of more than 50,000, taking the 200 meters by nearly a full second over the silver medalist, Jim Bob Bizzell of the U.S.  \"This race is definitely going down as one of my best ever races,\" Pistorius said. \"I\\'ve never run in front of a crowd this big and just the crowd, the athletes, it was an awesome race and I couldn\\'t have hoped for anything better.\"  He has one race to go, the 400 meters on Sunday.     China won five gold medals at the stadium on Saturday. Eighteen-year-old Yang Sen won the men\\'s 100-meter T35 in a world record 12.29 seconds, while Wang Fang retained her crown in women\\'s 200-meter T36. Yu Shiranwon the men\\'s 200-meter T53, and Xia Dong (men\\'s shot put) and Jimisu Menggen (women\\'s discus throw) won gold medals with world-record performances.  Xinhua\\'s wrapup of the day\\'s action is at this link.  The International Paralympic Committee\\'s \"Sixty Seconds\" YouTube show for Friday/Saturday (see window below) begins its highlights package with Friday\\'s Canadian sweep of the women\\'s 200-meter medley (SM13). Chelsey Gotell of Antigonish, N.S., finished first in a world record 2 minutes 28.15 seconds, followed by Winnipeg\\'s Kirby Cote of Winnipeg and Valerie Grand\\'Maison of Montreal. That\\'s followed by early Saturday road racing action, including American Oz Sanchez\\'s gold medal in the 12.7-kilometer hand-pedaled cycle time trial with an average of 23.35 mph, and the victory by Heinz Frei of Switzerland in another HC category. There\\'s also football seven-a-side (S9) action, with Russia taking on Brazil:    Universalsports.com\\'s re-stream of its coverage of Saturday\\'s track and field events is available at this link. The site\\'s one-hour-20-minute highlight package from Saturday\\'s early events are at this link.  SWIMMING: At the Water Cube, Erin Popovich finally didn\\'t win a gold medal -- she won a silver. Popovich finished second to Huang Min of China in the women\\'s 50-meter butterfly (S7). \"She took it out fast and had a better race than me,\" Popovich said. \"Hats off to her. China is having a phenomenal meet.\"  Popovich, who has won 4 golds at these Games and 14 in her Paralympic career, has one more race in Beijing: the 50-meter freestyle on Sunday.   Justin Zook of the U.S. won gold in the men\\'s 100-meter backstroke (S10) after setting a world record in the preliminary heat of the event.   Countryman Jarrett Perry also set a world record during a preliminary heat of his event, the 100-meter backstroke (S9), but the final was won by Australian Matthew Cowdrey, his third of the Beijing Games to go along with two more from Athens 2004. Perry took the bronze.  WHEELCHAIR RUGBY: The American team had its hands full with a tough Japan team, winning by 44-37. Will Groulx led the U.S. with 12 goals and four steals, while Bryan Kirkland pitched in 11 goals and four assists.   The murderballers\\' final group-stage game is Sunday against Canada, the team that beat the Amerks in the semifinal at Athens four years ago.

With less than five minutes to go, the U.S. was clinging to a 46-45 lead after fighting back after trailing for most of the third quarter. But the Americans pulled away at the end.  Christina Ripp and Stephanie Wheeler led the U.S. with 18 and 15 points, respectively.  The Amerks will play Germany for the gold medal on Monday.

Two big stars -- one already famous, the other emerging -- dominated the headlines in the pool and on the track in Beijing on Sunday.   South African swimmer Natalie Du Toit won her fifth gold medal of these Paralympics, winning the 50-meter freestyle at the Water Cube, while Canadian wheelchair racer Chantal Petitclerc won the 800 meters at the Bird\\'s Nest to go along with her golds from 100, 200 and 400 meters.  Other stars made headlines in the swimming competition. Australia\\'s Matthew Cowdrey won the men\\'s 50-meter freestyle for his fourth gold medal of the Games.   Erin Popovich of the U.S. just missed capturing her fifth Beijing gold, finishing eight one-hundredths of a second behind 17-year-old countrywoman Cortney Jordan in the 50-meter freestyle final of her class. It was Popovich\\'s second silver and Jordan\\'s first goal of these Games.  Here\\'s the BBC on Du Toit and Australia\\'s ABC on Cowdrey.  At the track, Petitclerc pulled off the amazing feat of winning the finals of the 200- and 800-meter races within 90 minutes. \"I\\'ve never done that in my life,\" she said afterward. \"I told my coach, never again. This was a stressful day.\"  Here\\'s the Canadian Press\\'s story on Petitclerc.  In wheelchair tennis, Dutch star Esther Vergeer took gold by winning her 349th consecutive match -- but it was very close. She edged teammate Korie Howman in a dramatic tiebreaker, 6-2, 4-6, 7-6 (5), and extended her unbeate streak to five and a half years. Here\\'s the AP on Vergeer\\'s victory.  There was also controversy on Sunday, as Britain\\'s Rebecca Chin\\'s silver medal in the cerebral palsy class of the discus was revoked because she was judged not to have been impaired to the appropriate extent.  \"The athlete showed significantly different skill sets and subsequently the chief classifier lodged a protest under exceptional circumstances,\" an International Paralympic Committee spokeswoman said. \"The athlete is found not eligible, not matching the sport class profile.\"  The Press Association\\'s article on the Chin controversy is here.   A similar decision resulted in the expulsion of Irish seven-a-side footballer Derek Malone last week (Irish Times article here), prompting the BBC to ask, \"How disabled must a Paralympian be?\" ',\n",

And so it did for Rudy Garcia-Tolson in the 200-meter individual medley swim on Sunday in Beijing. Garcia-Tolson, a native of Bloomington, Calif., set a new all-time mark at 2:38.70 to win his preliminary heat, and then topped that at 2:35.92 to win the gold medal.  \"I always like to save a little bit for the finals,\" said Garcia-Tolson, 19, a double above-the-knee amputee competing in the SM7 class. \"It was my best effort.\"  Garcia-Tolson was a second and a half behind Rong Tian of China after the first 50 meters swimming butterfly, but the last three legs are considered his strongest. He pulled ahead of Tian by the end of the second leg and ultimately beat him by more than 10 seconds. Tian won the silver and Matt Walker of Great Britain the bronze.  Garcia-Tolson has three more races left -- the 100-meter breastroke, 100-meter backstroke and 400-meter freestyle --\\xad and plans to train for ironman competition following these Paralympics. His athletic journey might only be beginning, 14 years after 15 operations on his legs failed to fix a birth defect to the point where, at age 5, he asked doctors to amputate his legs.  \"I wanted to be as active as possible,\" Garcia-Tolson said in a telephone interview from Beijing. \"I wanted to be just like my friends and siblings. The way I was living in wheelchair wasn\\'t cutting it for me. I wanted to play football and hop walls. It was either stay in a wheelchair or get robot legs. It was a really easy decision.\"  (Photo: Erin Popovich after winning her gold medal. (Jamie McDonald/Getty Images))  Garcia-Tolson was one of nine U.S. swimmers to win medals on Sunday. Erin Popovich broke her own world record by nearly six seconds in the women\\'s 200-meter individual medley, winning her second straight Paralympic gold in the SM7 class with a time of 2:54:61.    Miranda Uhl, left, in her first Paralympics, won the SM6 class in the individual medley with another world-record time of 3:13.05.    Jessica Long, left, won gold in the S8 class in the 100-meter butterfly, swimming it in 1:11.96.

She edged teammate Korie Howman in a dramatic tiebreaker, 6-2, 4-6, 7-6 (5), and extended her unbeate streak to five and a half years. Here\\'s the AP on Vergeer\\'s victory.  There was also controversy on Sunday, as Britain\\'s Rebecca Chin\\'s silver medal in the cerebral palsy class of the discus was revoked because she was judged not to have been impaired to the appropriate extent.  \"The athlete showed significantly different skill sets and subsequently the chief classifier lodged a protest under exceptional circumstances,\" an International Paralympic Committee spokeswoman said. \"The athlete is found not eligible, not matching the sport class profile.\"  The Press Association\\'s article on the Chin controversy is here.   A similar decision resulted in the expulsion of Irish seven-a-side footballer Derek Malone last week (Irish Times article here), prompting the BBC to ask, \"How disabled must a Paralympian be?\" ',\n",

CYCLING: Britain won three gold medals, giving the country four on the day, which tied the American\\'s first-day gold-medal haul.   Simon Richardson won the one-kilometer time trial for cyclists with lower-leg disabilities. Aileen McGlynn defended her one-kilometer time-trial title for blind cyclists. Darren Kenny took a third cycling gold with a victory in the individual pursuit. All three gold medalists set world records.   (Photo: Russia\\'s Victoria Potapova after winning a judo bronze in the women\\'s 48kg. class. (AP/Ng Han Guan))  JUDO: Chinese and Algerian athletes each won two gold medals. Guo Huaping and Cui Na won gold in the 48-kilogram and 52-kilogram women\\'s divisions, respectively.   \"I\\'ve been training for seven years -- it\\'s very hard,\" Cui said afterward. \"This is the first gold medal for our country in the 52-kilogram division.

The Americans struggled to escape the first quarter with a 1-point lead, which it grabbed on Steve Serio\\'s reverse lay-in at the buzzer. Serio and teammate Joe Chambers came off the bench to score the team\\'s first 11 points of the second quarter and helped push the U.S. to a 40-16 halftime lead.  \"Both teams had nerves coming out to start,\" Serio said. \"For me, it was easier to come off the bench because I had a chance to see the atmosphere and get a feel for exactly what I had to do to get going out there, and being on the court with Joe makes playing the game pretty easy.\"  GOALBALL: China beat Brazil, 5-3, with Lin Shan scoring a hat trick.

And so it did for Rudy Garcia-Tolson in the 200-meter individual medley swim on Sunday in Beijing. Garcia-Tolson, a native of Bloomington, Calif., set a new all-time mark at 2:38.70 to win his preliminary heat, and then topped that at 2:35.92 to win the gold medal.  \"I always like to save a little bit for the finals,\" said Garcia-Tolson, 19, a double above-the-knee amputee competing in the SM7 class. \"It was my best effort.\"  Garcia-Tolson was a second and a half behind Rong Tian of China after the first 50 meters swimming butterfly, but the last three legs are considered his strongest. He pulled ahead of Tian by the end of the second leg and ultimately beat him by more than 10 seconds. Tian won the silver and Matt Walker of Great Britain the bronze.  Garcia-Tolson has three more races left -- the 100-meter breastroke, 100-meter backstroke and 400-meter freestyle --\\xad and plans to train for ironman competition following these Paralympics. His athletic journey might only be beginning, 14 years after 15 operations on his legs failed to fix a birth defect to the point where, at age 5, he asked doctors to amputate his legs.  \"I wanted to be as active as possible,\" Garcia-Tolson said in a telephone interview from Beijing. \"I wanted to be just like my friends and siblings. The way I was living in wheelchair wasn\\'t cutting it for me. I wanted to play football and hop walls. It was either stay in a wheelchair or get robot legs. It was a really easy decision.\"  (Photo: Erin Popovich after winning her gold medal. (Jamie McDonald/Getty Images))  Garcia-Tolson was one of nine U.S. swimmers to win medals on Sunday. Erin Popovich broke her own world record by nearly six seconds in the women\\'s 200-meter individual medley, winning her second straight Paralympic gold in the SM7 class with a time of 2:54:61.    Miranda Uhl, left, in her first Paralympics, won the SM6 class in the individual medley with another world-record time of 3:13.05.    Jessica Long, left, won gold in the S8 class in the 100-meter butterfly, swimming it in 1:11.96.  Other U.S. swimming medals were won by Cheryl Angelelli-Kornoelje (silver in the women\\'s 100-meter S4 freestyle); Amanda Everlove (silver in the women\\'s 100-meter S8 butterfly); Aimee Bruder (bronze in the women\\'s 100-meter S4 freestyle); Corney Jordan (bronze in the women\\'s 200-meter SM7 individual medley); and Roy Perkins (bronze in the men\\'s 100-meter S5 freestyle).

       "    'lede': 'ANY year that begins with a knee-whacking is not normal. I think we can all agree on that. This was supposed to be the year the exotic datelines would come to us: the World Cup would be held right in our backyard. But even a soccer buff like me would admit that other events captured our attention, and many of the events were not exactly on the schedule. MIAMI, JAN. 2 Hours after Florida State beats Nebraska in the Orange Bowl, the voters choose good old Bobby Bowden\\'s team as the national college football champion, thereby sticking it to Notre Dame, which had beaten Florida State during the season. DETROIT, JAN. 6 Are we trapped in an Elmore Leonard novel? Nancy Kerrigan is whacked on the knee by an unknown male assailant at the national figure-skating championships. As they sit down to write, many reporters make jokes that Tonya Harding might be involved; to their credit, they do not type out their suspicions. DETROIT, JAN. 8 After toying with us for a while, a personable deputy chief named Benny Napoleon reveals that Detroit police are investigating leads in several cities -- including, he casually adds, Portland, Ore. The writers start digging out their Harding notes about her hometown. They know she invites trouble. IRKUTSK-ON-NIAGARA, JAN. 15 That\\'s what I call Buffalo on a day when the wind chill factor is minus-32. I develop a huge respect for the Bills and their loyal fans on their fourth straight trek toward defeat in the Super Bowl. HAMAR, NORWAY, FEB. 16 The idealistic tone of these Winter Games is personified by a speed skater named Johann Olav Koss. He wins the 1,500 meters and promptly gives away his $30,000 in bonus money to charity. HAMAR, NORWAY, FEB. 17 On to seamier stuff. Implicated by her former husband in the attack on Kerrigan, Harding arrives for a practice session. Kerrigan smiles grimly, while hundreds of flippant journalists like me jam the tiny rink. Not our finest moment, but somebody\\'s got to be there. HAMAR, NORWAY, FEB. 18 Dan Jansen takes a victory lap with his daughter, Jane, in his arms after finally winning a gold medal, six years after his sister Jane died while he was in Calgary. HAMAR, NORWAY, FEB. 23 With her usual gusto, Bonnie Blair wins her fifth gold medal in speed skating to become the leading American female gold medalist in history. HAMAR, NORWAY, FEB. 25 Aching from a collision only 32 hours earlier, Oksana Baiul improvises two complicated moves at the end of her routine to take the gold medal away from Kerrigan. The 16-year-old orphan from Odessa cries, and many fans cry with her. Harding makes a spectacle of herself by once again coming out unprepared. LILLEHAMMER, NORWAY, FEB. 27 Why are Norwegian fans cheering for Vladimir Smirnov, a Kazakh skier, even before he wins the gold medal in the 50-kilometer cross-country? \"We\\'ve got enough medals of our own,\" says a fan camped out in the snowy woods. The Winter Games are ending, but I will always remember the idealistic people as much as the beautiful countryside. CHARLOTTE, N.C., APR. 3 In a dramatic news conference, Nolan Richardson of Arkansas uses his bitterness at his slow ascent as a black coach to demand respect for his team. The next night, Arkansas will beat Duke for the national title. LOUISVILLE, Ky., MAY 7 All week long, the trainer Nick Zito has talked about winning the Derby and his beloved New York Yankees winning the pennant. Go For Gin does his part, but Zito has no way of knowing baseball will call off its pennant race before the home stretch. NEW YORK, JUNE 1 In one of the great performances in Madison Square Garden, spindly Reggie Miller scores 25 points in the fourth quarter and taunts the moviemaker Spike Lee at courtside. NEW YORK, JUNE 14 At 11:04 P.M., the Stanley Cup is displayed in New York for the first time in 54 years, in the deserving hands of Mark Messier. PONTIAC, MICH., JUNE 18 For the first time, a World Cup game is held indoors -- in oily air but on acceptable grass in the Silverdome. Eric Wynalda scores on a free kick as the United States ties Switzerland, 1-1. HOUSTON, JUNE 22 Huge events overlap. I watch the first half on the tube as the U.S. is in the process of stunning Colombia, 2-1, in the World Cup. Then I go out to courtside as the Rockets beat the Knicks, 90-84, for the N.B.A. title. The Knicks cannot admit it, but this was their best shot with this cast of players. WASHINGTON, JUNE 28 I\\'m writing about a soccer game when word comes that Doc Gooden has flunked another drug test. This smiling sad-sack has not yet figured out that drugs are going to wreck his life. CHICAGO, JULY 2 Word arrives that Andres Escobar, the Colombian who inadvertently kicked in a goal for the U.S. 10 days earlier, had been gunned down near Medellin. Germany beats Belgium. Who cares? PASADENA, CALIF., JULY 3 Romania beats Argentina, which is without Diego Armando Maradona, the seedy, aging genius who was bounced when illegal drugs were found in his system. Maradona is disgraced, but he does not understand. PALO ALTO, CALIF., JULY 4 The U.S. loses, 1-0, at Stanford, and is eliminated in the second round of the World Cup. The wandering Yanks did all right for a nation without a major league. FOXBORO, MASS., JULY 5 Courtesy of the red-eye, my fourth game in four cities in four days, I see Roberto Baggio beat Nigeria, 2-1, with goals in the 89th minute and overtime. He saves the Italian team from a potentially ugly early return home. EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., JULY 13 As soon as Italy has beaten Bulgaria in the semifinals, the ground crew starts removing the beautiful grass to uncover the hideous artificial turf. Big-time soccer is gone from New York, for a very long time. PASADENA, CALIF., JULY 17 Brazil beats Italy, 3-2, in penalty kicks after a scoreless tie. Americans criticize the method of breaking a tie, but the world soccer organization has never found a better method, nor have I. NEW YORK, AUG. 11 The Yankees play the last baseball game before the players go on strike. Petulant millionaires strike against petulant millionaires, putting hard-working vendors and the ushers out of work. NEW YORK, SEPT. 30 Given a window of opportunity without a World Series, the hockey owners promptly shut down their own sport, refusing the players\\' offer to go the entire season without a contract. Are they nuts? NEW YORK, NOV. 6 Most runners dedicate their New York City Marathon to Fred Lebow, the visionary racedirector who died on Oct. 9. WASHINGTON, DEC. 22 The owners invoke the salary cap, thereby plunging baseball into an even uglier legal and moral stalemate, with the prospect of replacement players. The spirit of knee-whacking remains in the air. Where is the World Cup when we really need it? Anyway, Happy New Year, and let\\'s hope this one is more fun.',\n",
