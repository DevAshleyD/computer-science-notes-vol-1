- "Each dot represents 100 people": move up under the subhead in the chart
- Scroll -- need to make it scroll further down. Can't see the "irradiated in womb" section
- Make the text activate earlier 

making changes to the COUNTING chart:
- colour difference on the line different and good
- maybe take the dot off??
- make different verisons where one dot IS one person, and use the wee people icon
- make sure they know how much more scrolling there is
- that's enough people for XXX buses/football fields (how many people fit in/max capacity on xxx. compare to CITIES. that's the exact number of people who live in XX city. That's the same number of people who live on Staten Island today.)
