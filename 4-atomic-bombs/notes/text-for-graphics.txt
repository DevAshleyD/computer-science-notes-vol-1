TEXTS FOR GRAPHICS:

On August 6, 1945,
the United States detonated
the world’s first atomic bomb
on Hiroshima.
Three days later, on 
August 9, the U.S. detonated
a second atomic bomb on 
Nagasaki.
There is no clear record of how many people were killed.

One estimate puts the toll at
140,000 people dead in
Hiroshima and 74,000 dead in
Nagasaki by the end of 1945.

Half of the people within a
1.2-km radius of the bombs 
died on the day of detonation.



爆心地から1.2キロメートルでは、その日のうちにほぼ50％が死亡し、それよりも爆心地に近い地域では80～100％と推定されています。

Roughly half of the deaths in each city occurred on the first day. Large numbers of people continued to die for months afterward from the effects of burns, radiation sickness, and other injuries, compounded by illness and malnutrition. In both cities, most of the dead were civilians, although Hiroshima had a sizable military garrison.
