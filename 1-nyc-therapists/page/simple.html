      <p class="body-text">Break-ups, new jobs, deaths in the family, a general sense of inadequacy - anything can send you spirilling down, and the solution seems obvious: Go see a shrink.</p>
      <p class="body-text">One in five adults in the United States, or about 47 million people, experience some sort of mental health disorder in a given year, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness.</p>

      <p class="chart-title">CBT is in, psychoanalysis is out</p>
      <p class="chart-subhead">CBT, which focuses on changing patterns in behaviour or thought, has been increasingly popular among newer therapists. One in four therapists who graduated between 2012-2017 practice CBT, whereas only five percent of therapists who graduated between 1957-1962 use this treatment. (Read more about CBT <a href="https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/cognitive-behavioral">here)</a></p>
      <p class="chart-subhead">Psychoanalysis, first developed by Sigmund Freud, traditionally focuses on investigating the unconscious mind and releasing repressed emotions, desires, and memories. It has become a controversial discipline, with many of its theories contested or debunked.</p>
      <p class="chart-subhead">Psychoanalysis was hot in the 1950s and 1960s. One in five therapists who graduated between 1957-1962 practice psychoanalysis, compared to nine percent of therapists who graduated between 2012-2017.
