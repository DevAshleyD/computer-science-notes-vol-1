CLASS CRITIQUE:

- red - confusing bc inconsistency
- put 911 rectangles into perspective?
- label: 20 survivors

STACKED CHART:
- label colours in the stacked bar chart
- gridlines?
- annotations - too busy?
- get rid of 40 years after annotation? (add more context - 40 years after the bombing, the government made a push to xxxx) maybe get rid off the actual numbers if we have gridlines
- highlight bar that are annotated
- gridlines go BEHIND datapoints/bars
- either gridlines OR numbers?
- regular years on x-axis, label years in annotation
- use ai2html

SCROLLY (population)
- put the 911 graphic next to the bigger chart? 
- 1000 people label -- to small
- maybe don't add perspective?
- instead of comparing to 911, compare to nagasaki/hiroshima cities?

SCROLLY (stories)
- ai2html
- video/photos of survivors
