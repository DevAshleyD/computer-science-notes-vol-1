<div class="story-body">
      <p class="body-text serif">On August 6, 1945, at 8:15 am, the United States dropped the worldâ€™s first atomic bomb on Hiroshima. Buildings crumbled; homes exploded into flames; flesh melted. The heat branded the patterns of the kimono onto the skin of survivors. Some were vapourised, leaving nothing but a <a href="http://www.gensuikin.org/english/photo.html">shadow etched onto stone.</a></p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Three days later, at 11:02 am on August 9, the United States dropped a second atomic bomb on the port city of Nagasaki.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">The bombs killed thousands instantly. Others died slowly from burns, radiation sickness and other injuries in the months and years that followed.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">In 1952, seven years after the bombing of Hiroshima, the city began compiling a list of those who had been killed by the atomic bomb. Nagasaki city began its own list in 1968, over two decades after the bombings.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Every year, on August 6 and 9, Hiroshima and Nagasaki hold memorial services to rememeber those killed by the bombs and to pray for world peace. As part of the ritual, they add the names of those who were newly registered in the lists.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">The two cities have different requirements for who can be included in their lists. In both, relatives of the deceased apply to register the deaths. Hiroshima accepts applications for all victims, regardless of nationality or whether they were recognised by the government as being <em>hibakusha</em>, or atomic bomb survivors. Nagasaki accepts only those who had been recognised by the government as being hibakusha.

<div class="story-body">
      <p class="body-text serif">There is no clear record of exactly how many people were killed. By the end of the year, the bombs had killed about 140,000 in Hiroshima and 74,000 in Nagasaki, according to the Atomic Heritage Foundation. This is around 72 times the number of people killed in the September 11, 2001 attack, and is roughly equal to the population of Des Moines, Iowa.</p>

      <p class="body-text serif">The names on the lists are not public. The stories of many victims of atomic bombs are lost - there are tombs in Hiroshima and Nagashima that house the ashes of tens of thousands of people whose identities are unknown, or whose entire families have died.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Some organisations collect testimonials and artwork by survivors. In many, people recount a blinding flash of light; the mushroom cloud towering over the city; and the "black rain" - the radioactive rain that fell after the bombing of Hiroshima. A 97-year-old woman, who was 24 at the time, recounts rubbing cucumber juice on her burns to ease the pain because they had no medication. Another survivor, who was 16 at the time, remembers seeing a dead boy standing an umbrella rack, as if leaning on it for support, and burned bodies that looked like mannequins.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Using information from the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum and the National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, I compiled a database of 1,312 testimonials by atomic bomb survivors.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Most of the testimonials come from survivors who were between 0 and 30 years old at the time of the bombings. Here is a selection of their stories.</p>
