Air samples collected at specific NYCCAS monitoring sites along with information about emissions sources were incorporated into a statistical model that predicted pollutant concentrations at all locations in NYC for the specified time period. The results were then assigned to the appropriate NYC neighborhood and averaged. In NYC, fine particulate matter is measured in units of micrograms per cubic meter of air.
